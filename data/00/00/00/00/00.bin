before the big guy gets involved.

6
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,416
Mom, I really need to talk
to you about Jack.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,208
Hey, could we change the subject?

8
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:22,833
I need your help with a few decisions
on the Bishop holiday party.

What if that's our deal?

10
00:00:24,291 --> 00:00:26,500
You get us materials for a new costume.

11
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:30,166
How about enough materials to make
your costumes plus two more?

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,166
I promise you
this is all a big misunderstanding.

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:35,208
I've obviously been framed.

14

15
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:46,833
Yes. Your boss.

Look at this. Who's that with my mom?

20

25

We've had a good relationship,
haven't we, Wilson?

26
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,291
Yes.

27
00:02:28,291 --> 00:02:31,625
I've never asked questions,
I've always done what was told.

28
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:36,166
What I'd expect when there's a debt,
and your husband owed a small fortune.

29
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:38,875
Which I have repaid tenfold by now.

for yourself.

31

Like you said,
it's been a good relationship,

32

which is why I'm a little confused
where you're headed with this.

My fiancé is taking the fall for Sloan.

35

But my daughter,
my daughter is home now,

36
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,458
and she's getting too close.

37
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,916
And that's where I draw the line.

38
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,625
There are no lines in this business.

39
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:15,375
And that is why
I have to leave this business.

40
00:03:15,458 --> 00:03:16,541

Oh, wow.

doesn't even, she doesn't even jaywalk.

"If he could do that,
then I didn't have to be scared."

645
00:54:59,083 --> 00:55:02,541
<i>And Lord knows they're easy on the eyes</i>

646
00:55:02,625 --> 00:55:05,791
<i>Black Widow's a knockout</i>
<i>Who can knock you out</i>

647
00:55:05,875 --> 00:55:09,166
<i>And when Ant-Man flies,</i>
<i>You won't hear a sound</i>

648
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:11,083
<i>While Hawkeye seems cool</i>

649
00:55:11,166 --> 00:55:12,708
<i>Like a really nice guy</i>

650
00:55:12,791 --> 00:55:17,541
<i>He just wished that New York</i>
<i>Wasn't their battleground</i>

651
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:20,000
<i>I've got to get the Tesseract</i>

652
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,541
<i>The battle's just begun</i>

653
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:23,000
<i>We'll conquer the Chitauri</i>

654
00:55:23,083 --> 00:55:24,958
<i>Then get shawarma when we're done</i>

655
00:55:25,083 --> 00:55:26,625
<i>Just how are we to fight them?</i>

656
00:55:26,708 --> 00:55:28,291
<i>We'll do it as a team</i>

657
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:30,000
<i>First Thor, unleash your lightning</i>

658
00:55:30,083 --> 00:55:31,875
<i>-Then Natasha, that's your cue</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

659
00:55:31,958 --> 00:55:33,333
<i>Then Hawkeye, hit the bullseye</i>

660
00:55:33,416 --> 00:55:35,375
<i>-There's no better shot than you</i>
-Right.

661
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:37,000
<i>Tony, you've got nukes to catch</i>

662
00:55:37,083 --> 00:55:38,500
<i>-Be careful not to crash</i>
-Yep.

663
00:55:38,583 --> 00:55:40,583
<i>And Hulk, you know the magic word is...</i>

664
00:55:40,666 --> 00:55:42,333
<i>Hulk, you know the magic word is</i>

665
00:55:42,416 --> 00:55:44,125
<i>Hulk, you know the magic word is</i>

666
00:55:44,208 --> 00:55:46,750
<i>Smash smash smash!</i>

667
00:55:46,833 --> 00:55:48,916
<i>Smash!</i>

668
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,000
<i>Save the city and help us win</i>

669
00:55:52,416 --> 00:55:55,458
<i>Save us all from the state we're in</i>

670
00:55:55,916 --> 00:56:00,791
<i>Things look dark,</i>
<i>But I know this can't be the end</i>

671
00:56:00,875 --> 00:56:02,500
<i>It can't be the end</i>

672
00:56:02,666 --> 00:56:05,875
<i>If the city's trashed</i>
<i>When you take your bow</i>

673
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,291
<i>We'll blame you then,</i>
<i>But you're good for now</i>

674
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:14,333
<i>Avengers unite</i>
<i>'Cause we've got to hear you say</i>

675
00:56:14,833 --> 00:56:18,625
<i>Got to hear you</i>
<i>Got to hear you say</i>

676
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:20,541
<i>I could do this all day</i>

677
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:23,083
<i>Save the city and help us win</i>

678
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:25,625
<i>Save us all from the state we're in</i>

679
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:28,416
<i>I could do this all day</i>

680
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:33,583
<i>We could do this all day!</i>
